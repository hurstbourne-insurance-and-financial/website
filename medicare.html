        <h3>Why Understanding Medicare Matters</h3>
        <p>Medicare provides valuable healthcare coverage, but it&#39;s not all-inclusive. Original Medicare (Parts A and B) leaves gaps, such as deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance, which can add up quickly. Additionally, there&#39;s no cap on out-of-pocket expenses. This is where supplemental coverage, like Medigap, becomes essential.

        </p>

        <h3>How Medigap Enhances Your Medicare Coverage</h3>
        <div class="trust-section">
            
            <div class="trust-item">
                <h4>Original Medicare</h4>
                <p>The coverage provided by Original Medicare (Parts A and B) can often leave extensive costs that aggregate from copayments, coinsurance, and deductibles.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="trust-item">
                <h4>Bridging the Gap</h4>
                <p>Medigap, also known as Medical supplement, provides many different plans, that work towards filling the "gaps" of what is not covered by Original Medicare, so as to fight against the rising cost of healthcare and unexpected medical bills.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="trust-item">
                <h4>Benefits</h4>
                <p>To name a few, some of the good in a medigap plan stems from more predictable healthcare costs, freedom in choosing any hospitls in the US that accepts Medicare, and standarized plans across insurers for easy comparisons. </p>
